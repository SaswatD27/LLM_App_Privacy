You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token.As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
